# GBR20: Ethereum â†” GBR20

GBR20 native bridge between Ethereum and GBR20 is used to relay the GBR20 native token from GBR20 to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The GBR20 bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer GBR20 tokens between the GBR20 chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's GBR20 or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of GBR20 tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the GBR20 chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on GBR20 chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on GBR20 chain, waiting for all bridge validators on GBR20 chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On GBR20 you send native GBR20 token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the GBR20 token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the GBR20 token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the GBR20 native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
