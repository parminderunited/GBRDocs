# Network Overview and Key Metrics

GBR20 is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the GBR20 ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of GBR20.

The GBR20 blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the GBR20 core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on GBR20 is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

The following information will help you discover and connect to the GBR20 blockchain:
