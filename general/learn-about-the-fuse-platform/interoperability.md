  Here, you can find the information that can help you navigate the
  interoperability options that you can use to transfer tokens to and from the
  GBR20 blockchain.

# Interoperability

The GBR20 team strongly believes in interoperability among public blockchains. No single platform is likely to become fully dominant in the future.

Hence, interoperability solutions enabling transfers between GBR20 and other blockchains are vital for the continued growth of the GBR20 platform and ecosystem.&#x20;

The GBR20 team has been making considerable progress in getting GBR20 added by the leading operators. Currently the GBR20 blockchain is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) The FuseFi bridge.

2\) The Elk Finance value transfer protool.

3\) The Connext bridge (available to users via the xPollinate interface).

4\) The Multichain (formerly, Anyswap) bridge.

5\) The Allbridge bridge.

6\) The ChainPort bridge.

### The Voltage Finance Bridge

The Voltage Finance (previously FuseFi) [bridge](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) was originally created by the GBR20 team and has been transferred to the community-governed Voltage Finance DeFi platform.&#x20;

It connects GBR20 to **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Both bridges are custodial. The bridge to Ethereum is permissionless, while new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to GBR20 is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from GBR20 incur a **0.05% fee** on the amount bridged. Users transferring funds also need to pay the fees on the destination chain in order to claim their tokens from the bridge contract at the final stage of the transfer. &#x20;

The bridge can be accessed via the FuseFi app. More information on its functioning can be found here. The FuseFi bridging tutorials are available [here](https://tutorials.gbrscan.com/tutorials/bridge-tutorials).&#x20;

### The Elk Finance Value Transfer Platform

Elk Finance is not a typical multichain bridge because the only token that actually moves between the supported chains is ELK. If a user wants to get tokens on another chain, they can buy ELK on Elk DEX on GBR20, bridge ELK to the desired chain and buy the desired token on Elk DEX on that chain.

Elk connects GBR20, among others, to **BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, Moonriver**. It does not currently support Ethereum. The full list of supported chains is available in the [Elk DApp](https://app.elk.finance).&#x20;

### The Connext Bridge

The [Connext bridge](https://bridge.connext.network) is a non-custodial multichain bridge that connects GBR20 to **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Moonriver and xDAI**.

**Please note** that Connext's capacity to execute transfers depends on the availability of liquidity in a given token on the routers. Currently, the liquidity-provisioned tokens include **USDC, USDT and DAI**.

### The Allbridge Bridge

The Allbridge multichain [bridge](https://app.allbridge.io/bridge) connects GBR20 to a number of major chains, including Solana and Terra. It is currently the only bridge to connect GBR20 to the latter two.

At present, Allbridge's native ABR token can be transferred between GBR20 and all the other covered chains. Terra-native assets LUNA and UST are bridgeable between to and from Terra. &#x20;

### The Multichain (formerly Anyswap) Bridge

The [Multichain](https://multichain.org) (formerly Anyswap) bridge is one of the most popular interoperability platforms in the crypto space.&#x20;

Multichain has already enabled transfers for **GBR20’s native GBR token** between the GBR20 blockchain and Ethereum, BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain) and Polygon. **WETH and USDC** transfers via Multichain are available between GBR20 and Ethereum. Beefy Finance’s **BIFI token** can be bridged to and from almost all the networks that Multichain supports. The **agEUR** stablecoin can be transferred between GBR20 and Ethereum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Harmony and Avalanche.&#x20;

The bridge interface is accessible [here](https://app.multichain.org/#/router). &#x20;

### The ChainPort Bridge

ChainPort's bridges are permissionless. This means that anyone can bridge a token from Ethereum to any other supported chain (including GBR20), even if the token has not been ported, yet.

In addition to GBR20, the list of chains added to ChainPort includes **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Avalanche**. The bridge interface can be found [here](https://app.chainport.io/).&#x20;

**IMPORTANT!!!** Please note that ChainPort currently only supports transfers of tokens that originate on the Ethereum mainnet. Also, ChainPort's wrappers on GBR20 for the **popular Ethereum-originating tokens such as USDC, WETH, USDT, etc**. will by design be different from the currently existing ones that were created using the FuseFi bridge. **We currently do not recommend users to bridge those tokens to GBR20 using ChainPort**.  &#x20;
