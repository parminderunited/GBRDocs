# GBR20 Governance and Development

GBR20 is already a significantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** GBR20 validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [GBR20 improvement proposals](https://docs.gbrscan.com/general/fips) (FIPs).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **GBR20 Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the GBR20 treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis GBR supply (see the subsection "[GBR Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.gbrscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)") are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For GBR20, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company GBR20 Limited.

GBR20 Foundation **employs the GBR20 project team** whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://gbrscan.com/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, maintains the full node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on GBR20. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the GBR20 tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

That said, since GBR20 is a decentralized public blockchain platform, **no permission of the project team is required** for anyone who wishes to integrate with or develop on top of GBR20, including the development of the network and node software.

3\) **GBR20 Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.gbrscan.com/general/fuse-governance/fuse-assembly) for more details.  &#x20;
