# GBR20 Token (GBR)

The GBR token is the native currency of the GBR20 blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## GBR utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the GBR20 blockchain, GBR is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake GBR20 to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.gbrscan.com/](https://status.gbrscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked GBR. Which means validators with higher amounts of GBR20 staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any GBR holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of GBR they wish. They receive a share of the GBR20 block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As GBR is the native currency on GBR20, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, GBR transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of GBR tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the GBR20 platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
