# GBR on Other Chains

Interoperability with other major blockchains is important for the growth of GBR20 and the prospects of realizing its vision. One of the ways of securing it is through enabling the versions (wrappers) of GBR on other chains.&#x20;

Unlinke GBR on GBR20, those wrappers are TL20 tokens are created whenever someone locks a certain number of tokens on the GBR20 and gets issued the exact same amount of wrapper tokens on the target blockchain. If a user withdraws the wrapper from the target blockchain, the tokens burned and the GBR tokens on GBR20 are unlocked.&#x20;

Currently, wrapped versions of GBR token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.&#x20;
