**Now let’s learn how to stake GBR.**

**Step 6:** Click on **“Contract”** and then click on Interact with contract and

1. Enter the consensus contract address **0x786Aa3227317A2e513cFE20c5897F122650bd671**
2. Copy the consensus ABI from below link

**Step 7:**

From the drop down select the **“Delegate”** function and then copy the “**Validator address”** from the staking UI. Enter the amount of GBR you want to stake under **“Value in ETH”** and click on **“Write”**. In the below example I have copied ”Liquify” validators address to stake.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have staked your GBR successfully.

Now lets learn to withdraw the staked GBR.

**Step 8**: Follow Step 1 to Step 6 from above.

From the drop down select the **“Withdraw”** function and then copy the “**Validator address”** from the staking UI to which you have delegated your stake. Enter the amount of GBR you want to stake under **“\_amount\(uint256\)”, “value in ETH”** should be 0 and click on **“Write”**.

Review and confirm the transaction on your Ledger. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain it means you have unstaked your GBR successfully.
